Manual Emoji Upload
-------------------
Open your Org's customize pane and upload them by hand:

        https://<org>.slack.com/customize/emoji


3rd Party Uploader
------------------
Optionally there is a bulk uploader based in npm named [emojipacks][].

Emojipacks software relies on a newer version of nodejs than Ubuntu14 Ships.
I recommend installing it into a Container (Docker) or VM (Virtualbox),
and patching that environment as documented in [this comment][emojipacks-ubuntu]

Emojipacks relies on **plaintext credentials!!** so I recommend also
using a non-admin slack account, and change its password or delete the
account after uploading.
